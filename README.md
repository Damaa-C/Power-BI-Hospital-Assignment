## Dashboard Analysis & Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of hospital performance, disease patterns, and pharmacy operations. Each visual contributes specific insights that support management decision-making.

## Disease Patterns Across Counties

### Stacked Bar Chart (Diagnosis by County)

The stacked bar chart comparing diagnoses across counties shows that some diseases are consistently high across nearly all regions, indicating widespread public health concerns. At the same time, certain conditions are more concentrated in specific counties, suggesting possible regional influences such as environmental factors, population lifestyle, or access to early treatment.

This visual clearly highlights geographic disparities in disease burden, enabling management to design county-specific prevention and outreach programs rather than applying uniform strategies across all areas.

## Disease Trends Over Time

### Line Chart (Disease Cases by Month/Year)

The line chart reveals how disease occurrence changes over time. Some diagnoses show steady trends, while others fluctuate or peak during certain periods. These patterns may indicate seasonal illness trends or outbreak periods.

By tracking these trends, the hospital can better anticipate future demand for services, medication, and staffing, improving preparedness and reducing strain during high-demand periods.

## Pharmacy Cost and Revenue by Department

### Clustered Column Chart (Department vs Pharmacy Revenue/Cost)

This chart shows a clear variation in pharmacy spending across departments. A few departments contribute disproportionately to total pharmacy revenue and costs, even when their patient volumes are not the highest.

This indicates that pharmacy performance is influenced not only by the number of patients but also by the type and cost of treatments provided. Departments treating chronic or complex conditions tend to drive higher medication costs. This insight helps management focus cost-control and procurement strategies on the departments with the greatest financial impact.

## Medication Usage by Age Group

### Funnel Chart (Age Group vs Total Medication)

The age group analysis demonstrates that adults and seniors consume significantly more medication than children and youth. Seniors, in particular, show high medication usage, which is consistent with increased chronic disease prevalence in older populations.

This visual supports long-term planning for geriatric care services, chronic disease management programs, and medication stock forecasting.

##  Drug Category Cost Breakdown

### Bar Chart (Cost by Drug Category)

The donut chart highlights which drug categories contribute the largest share of pharmacy costs. A small number of categories account for most of the spending, suggesting that certain treatments dominate the pharmacy budget.

This allows the hospital to focus negotiations with suppliers, improve inventory management, and monitor high-cost drug categories more closely.

##  Relationship Between Visits and Pharmacy Revenue

### Scatter Plot (Total Visits vs Total Pharmacy Revenue)

The scatter plot shows a general upward trend between visits and pharmacy revenue, but the points are not evenly aligned. Some departments generate high revenue with relatively fewer visits, while others have many visits but lower revenue.

This demonstrates that higher patient volume does not always lead to proportionally higher pharmacy revenue. Instead, revenue is influenced by treatment complexity and medication type, which is crucial for accurate financial planning.

## Length of Stay vs Pharmacy Spending by Diagnosis

### Combo Chart (Average Length of Stay & Pharmacy Cost by Diagnosis)

The combo chart reveals that some diagnoses are associated with long hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending. This suggests that the cost of care for these cases is driven more by bed occupancy, monitoring, and clinical support than by medication.

Conversely, other diagnoses show shorter stays but higher pharmacy costs, indicating drug-intensive treatment. This distinction is important for hospital capacity planning and budgeting, as it highlights different types of resource demand.

## Summary of Findings

By combining insights from all visuals, the dashboard shows that:

-Disease burden varies by region and time

-Pharmacy revenue depends on case complexity, not just patient numbers

-A few departments and drug categories drive most pharmacy costs

-Older age groups are the largest consumers of medication

-Some conditions are stay-intensive, while others are drug-intensive

These findings provide hospital management with a strong foundation for resource allocation, budgeting, procurement planning, and targeted public health interventions.# Power-BI-Hospital-Assignment
